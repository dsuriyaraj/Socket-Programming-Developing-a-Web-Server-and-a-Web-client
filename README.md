# Socket-Programming:Developing-a-Web-Server-and-a-Web-client
Have used the PHP code for Developing a Web Server and a Web client using sockets.

##Execution Instructions:
1. Open a browser and go to http://ws.mss.icics.ubc.ca/~dsuriya/cics514/lab2/server.php to open the server connection which keeps on running for processing the client request.
2. Open another tab/browser window and type http://ws.mss.icics.ubc.ca/~dsuriya/cics514/lab2/client.php to open the client which requests the webpage content to the server.
3. HTML code for the requested webpage from the client present in the server is sent to the client and it gets displayed in the client page.
